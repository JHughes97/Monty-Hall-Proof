# Monty-Hall-Proof
Proof of the Monty Hall problem. (Python3)
In the Monty Hall problem 3 closed doors are presented to you. Behind one
of said doors is a car and behind the other two are goats. You may select 1
door, with the aim of finding the car. Once you have selected a door, one of
the other two doors behind which is a goat is opened. You then have the option to
stay with the door you originally picked or switch to the other unclosed door.
Do you have a better chance of finding the car if you stay or switch?
